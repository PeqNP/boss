# Generates "Word of the day" entries from the `dictionary.sqlite3` database
# generated by `create_dictionary.py`.
#
# The words are randomly assigned to a different day, starting from today, until
# all words are exhausted. For example, if there are 100 words, this will create
# a total of 100 word entries starting from today.
#
# This will generate a new `wordsy.sqlite3` database used by the app. The database
# contains all word entries and attempts made by users.
