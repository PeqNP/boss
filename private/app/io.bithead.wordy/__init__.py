#
# Wordy - A Wordle(TM)-like game.
#
# This is a state machine that tracks the puzzle date by user.
#
# When the user first queries for either `/word`, or `/word/{date}`, the
# user's state will be configured to work on that specific puzzle's date.
#
# Calls to `/guess/{word}`, `/friends`, etc. will use this date.
