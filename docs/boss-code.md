# BOSSCode

BOSSCode is an IDE that allows you to create new BOSS apps.

It provides:

- A simple UI, and project structure, to develop BOSS apps
- Directly preview controllers w/o needing to open the app or navigate to where the controller is within the app
- Works great with other dev environments. You can modify the files locally on disk and the IDE will auto-load the contents of the file before previewing the app.

BOSSCode apps are stored in the repository
