# Docker

BOSS comes with a Docker container, which you can download [here](https://www.docker.com/example).

## Build your own container

To create your own container:

```
docker build -t boss --no-cache .
```

To inspect:

```
docker run -it boss /bin/bash
```

To run:

```
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name boss-web boss
```

Access from [http://localhost](http://localhost)

## Download `:latest` container

TBD

## Debugging

To debug the build process, create an image of the builder:

```
docker build --target builder -t boss-builder .
docker run -it boss-builder /bin/bash
```

> This allows you to see the artifacts created during the build process.


To see what files are taking the most space in your docker:

```
docker history boss
```

To see the total size `docker images`.

The size of the image should be less than 300MB, ~280MB.

To run individual services within the `boss` container

```
docker run -it boss /bin/bash
cd /boss
```

Python

```
./private/start
```

BOSS Swift+Vapor

```
/usr/local/bin/boss &
```

nginx

```
nginx -g "daemon off;"
```

> All of these commands are in `bin/entry`
