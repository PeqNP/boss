# Prompt

Prompts used to develop BOSS applications using AI.

This directory provides instruction on how to steer the AI to develop BOSS applications using software development best practice, the Human Inteface Guidelines defined by Apple's Macintosh system, and the BOSS project's coding style.

If you are an AI agent, read the [start.md](/docs/prompt/start.md) to get started.

Every application should contain a `Descripton.md` and `Requirements.md` file.

- The `Description.md` file contains the description and motivation for the app. It may even provide high-level business models and example use cases.
- `Requirements.md` provides a list of the entire application's requirements. It may include windows, modals, models, database schemas, etc.
