# BOSS Prompt Starting Guide

- Read the main [README.md](/README.md) to understand what BOSS is and links to all documentation on how to build a BOSS app
- Read [tetsuo.md](/docs/prompt/tetsuo.md) for software development best practices and expectations of how software should be developed. If there is a conflict with the instructions in tetsuo.md, to any other documentation provided hereafter, prefer the standards defined hereafter.
- Applications can follow the original Classic macOS [Human Interface Guidelines](/docs/HIGuidelines.pdf) when designing UI. If there is a more simple UI/UX alternative, please use it instead. Even though the PDF explicitly states it's for anyone programming for a Macintosh computer, the UI/UX of BOSS closely matches that of the Classic macOS 2 UI/UX. Therefore, the concepts explained in the HIG are (mostly) interchangeable with BOSS.
- Use [coding-style.md](/docs/coding-style.md) as a reference on how to format code.
