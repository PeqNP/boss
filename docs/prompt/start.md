# BOSS AI Code Generation Starting Guide

- Ignore all files listed in [ignore.md](/docs/prompt/ignore.md). If they are linked in any of the documents hereafter, they may be safely ingored.
- Read the main [README.md](/README.md), and follow all links, to understand what BOSS is and how to build a BOSS app
- Read [tetsuo.md](/docs/prompt/tetsuo.md) for software development best practices and expectations of how software should be developed. If there is a conflict with the instructions in tetsuo.md, to any other documentation provided hereafter, prefer the standards defined hereafter.
- Design apps using the same principles following the Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines (1992 edition). [Reference](/docs/HIGuidelines.pdf). BOSS uses the classic black-and-white / 1-bit era feel of System 7 apps. Emphasize direct manipulation, desktop metaphor, consistent menu commands, modal dialogs only when necessary, forgiving actions with undo, standard controls (e.g., radio buttons, checkboxes, scroll arrows). BOSS doesn't use modern Aqua/flat elements.
- Use [coding-style.md](/docs/coding-style.md) as a reference on how to format code.
- [code-generation-guidelines.md](/docs/prompt/code-generation-guidlines.md) provides guidlines on how to read, and use, the BOSS APIs.
