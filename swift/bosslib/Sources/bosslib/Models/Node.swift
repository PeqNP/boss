/**
 Represents a type of node within the organization

 These types are typically a grouping of one or more other nodes:
   - unknown (if `children` are provided)
   - client - has number of active clients
   - service - has resources
   - resource - has cluster of machines that provide resource
   - group - generic grouping

 All other types are meant to be "single", meaning they have no children. Also, not all of these types _have_ to have children. Especially when a system is first setup, there may be no children for a given node type. Instead, they are used to provide clarity as to the _type_, so that at a glance, it is easy to identify the node type.
