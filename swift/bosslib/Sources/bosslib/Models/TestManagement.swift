/// The `TestProject`, `TestSuite`, and `TestSuiteGroup` manage the references to the children in the tree.
/// Children IDs are `nil` when first being created or when updating the respective model's properties. Its children are _not_ managed through CRUD forms. Only when performing changes on the project tree. By setting this value to `nil` it is obvious which context this model is being used and when it is appropriate to update the children IDs or not. This also provides a required level of control as we don't want an end-user mucking around with the tree outside of the tree context. Especially, the `TestSuite`s, as their `TestProject` can not change. A very limited API is provided to move a `TestCase` up, or down, within the tree. There is no way to modify the tree outside of this context.
/// However, read ops _always_ return a list of IDs, regardless of the context. This is necessary for debugging, and building the tree.
